- Sequence	                Linear and Sequential	                   Iterative and Incremental
- Requirements	            Gathered at the beginning	               Evolve through collaboration
- Planning	                Predictive and detailed	                 Adaptive and flexible
- Delivery	                Focus on predictability	                 Focus on rapid delivery
- Change Management	        Difficult to accommodate changes	       Embracing change and feedback
- Team Structure	          Hierarchical and siloed	                 Cross-functional and collaborative
- Customer Involvement	    Limited involvement	Active               participation and feedback
= Risk Management	          Identify and mitigate risks upfront	     Manage risks through iterative delivery

Contrasting Points
- Predictive vs Adaptive Planning: Waterfall relies on detailed planning, while Agile adapts to changing requirements.
- Linear vs Iterative: Waterfall follows a sequential approach, whereas Agile uses iterative and incremental development.
- Focus on Predictability vs Delivery: Waterfall prioritizes predictability, whereas Agile emphasizes rapid delivery and customer satisfaction.
- Change Management: Waterfall struggles with changes, whereas Agile welcomes feedback and adaptation.

Similarities
